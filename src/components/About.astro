        I’m a Front-End Developer working with React, Astro, TailwindCSS, and JavaScript, and I’m actively growing my career in modern web development. My goal is to become a strong front-end engineer and eventually move into full-stack development as I continue to learn and build more complex projects.<br><br>
        Before focusing on development, I worked in IT infrastructure and automation, where I gained experience with Windows Server, Linux, Active Directory, networking, and PowerShell scripting. That background helps me think like a full-stack problem solver — I understand deployments, debugging, system behavior, and the bigger picture behind an application.<br><br>
        I enjoy learning, experimenting, and building things end-to-end. Recently, I’ve deployed multiple production projects using Astro, React, Vite and I continue improving both my coding skills and my understanding of modern web architectures.
